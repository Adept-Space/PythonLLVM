        for loops
             range function
        add math functions: sqrt, abs, exp, ceil/floor, mod, bitshift, div, log
            find way to add functions to symbol table (treat like visitAdd, but in func)
            figure out how to make ^ into llvmpy options

    maybe do if there's time:
        2D arrays
        free malloc'd arrays
