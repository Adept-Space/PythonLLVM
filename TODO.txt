THINGS TO DO:
    coding:
        add math functions: sqrt, abs, exp, ceil/floor, mod, bitshift, div, log
            - find way to add functions to symbol table (treat like visitAdd, but in func)
            - figure out how to make ^ into llvmpy options
            - range function
        vector math
        add field in dims for if string    
    maybe do if there's time:
        2D arrays
        free malloc'd arrays
    writing
        intro
        steps
            - memory management
            - scoping
                - modifying vars within if statements
                - returning in one branch of if statements
        existing work
